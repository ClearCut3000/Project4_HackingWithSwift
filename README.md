# Project4_HackingWithSwift
A simple training application that uses load View(), WKWebView, delegation, URL, URLRequest, UIToolbar, UIProgressView and key-value observing. 
Also added a TableViewController with a list of allowed sites and a UIAlertController in case a user tries to visit a site outside the list.
